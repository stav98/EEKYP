Stevenson screen for wireless meteorological sensor by Galto2000 on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:83969

Summary:
A Stevenson screen is an outdoor shelter for your meteorological sensors, such as those that come along with your electronic home weather station. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) agreed standard for the height of the screen is between 1.25 m (4ft 1 in) and 2 m (6ft 7 in). Its purpose is to provide a standardized environment in which to measure temperature, humidity, dew point and atmospheric pressure. The louvered design allows for the instrument to be sheltered from direct sunlight and rain, yet air is able to flow through the screen unrestricted.
